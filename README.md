### Focus Question:	Create a fashion trend prediction for e-commerce using EfficientNetB1-B7 on clustered fashion dataset
### Key Prior Knowledge;	
The use of publicly available fashion image dataset on Kaggle; Cleaning the data, preprocessing the data to fit the dimensions applicable for the pretrained model, clustering the images and train/test according to their categories using K-means and EfficientNets respectively.
### Concepts;	
Data gathering, data preprocessing, feature extraction with clustering, model training and evaluations. Prediction and visualization. 
### Methodology and Dataset;	
Fashion image dataset; Pandas, seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, Efficientnet, sklearn, clustering, K-means, matplotlib, os, NumPy, cv2. Confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristics) AUC (Area Under the Curve).
### Anticipated Outcome;
The outcome is to predict e-commerce fashion trends to a projected accuracy of 95% with computational efficiency and practical usage in industrial applications.
